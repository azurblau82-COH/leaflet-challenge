# leaflet-challenge

The first task is to visualize an earthquake data set.
'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days' dataset was used for visualization.
A map was created using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from this dataset based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color, i.e. earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color. Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked was included. A legend was created to provide context for the map data.
Attempt was also made to plot a second dataset on the map. Unfortunately, this effort was aborted due to time limit.
